1.	Assign the library
Read in EX and ECG data
2.	Complete proc transpose step with correct variables
3.	Calculate the mean hr(Round to 2 decimals)
4.	Generate BASE column as the baseline
5.	Select the right duplicated records
PROC PRINT with the proper title and columns
Generate the excel file using PROC EXPORT
6.	Calculate DOF with proper unit for each record 
Combined DOF values for duplicated records
7.	Calculate CHG=meanhr-base
Screening visit should be missing value
8.	Retain the proper MEANHR
Screening records should be excluded
9.	Retain the proper CHG
Screening records should be excluded
10.	Apply structured macro steps
Exact values for MEANHR and CHG
11.	Count N and n in ECG5 and ECG6
Proc Report is used to generate the same form as mock 
Exact title and header
12.	Derive baseline summary statistics exactly
Derive post baseline summary statistics exactly
Round to appropriate decimals
Proc Report is used to generate the same form as mock
